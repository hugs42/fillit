## About

Fillit is a project allowing you to discover and/or become familiar with a recurring problem in programming: the search for an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. 
In the case of this project, it will be a question of arranging Tetriminos between them and determining the smallest possible square that can accommodate them.
A Tetriminos is a geometric figure made up of 4 blocks that you know from the famous game Tetris.
